## üìÉ About the Project

### Architecture

#### Components

For this project I've decided to follow the [Single Responsability Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle): each component is gonna have responsability over one part of the functionality of the app. 

#### Imports

Dependencies from `node_modules` and project files must be separated by a blank line:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

import { store } from "../store";
```

#### Naming

- All names must be writen in English. Always. Till the end of times.

- Names should be clear, even if longer names are needed to do so.
- Types should be declared with Typescript, not within the function name.
- Interface declarations should start with a capital I.

#### Functions

- Avoid long (god) functions. If it gets too long, it must be divided into specific actions.

### Version Control

I've been tracking all the changes with git so if you want to understand how I build this project in a more specific manner, this section is a guide to my practices.

#### Branches

- `master` 
  - `develop`
    - `feature`
    - `fix`
    - `chore`
  - `hotfix`

#### Commit Messages
